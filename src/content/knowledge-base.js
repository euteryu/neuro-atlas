  'frontal-lobe': [
    'The frontal lobe is the last part of the brain to fully mature, often not until the mid-20s.',
    'Damage to the frontal lobe can result in dramatic personality changes, as seen in the case of Phineas Gage.',
    'Plays a key role in "executive functions" like planning, decision-making, and moderating social behavior.'
  ],
  'cerebellum': [
    'Containing over 50% of the brain\'s total neurons, the cerebellum is vital for motor coordination.',
    'Helps you perform smooth, balanced actions like walking, talking, and riding a bike.',
    'Alcohol has a profound and immediate effect on the cerebellum, explaining loss of balance and coordination.'
  ],
  'temporal-lobe': [
    'Home to the primary auditory cortex, this lobe is crucial for processing sounds and language.',
    'The hippocampus, located within the temporal lobe, is essential for forming long-term memories.',
    'Wernicke\'s area, critical for language comprehension, is typically found in the left temporal lobe.'
  ],
  'parietal-lobe': [
    'Integrates sensory information from various parts of the body, such as touch, temperature, and pain.',
    'Essential for spatial awareness, navigation, and understanding numerical relationships.',
    'Damage can lead to "hemispatial neglect," where a patient is unaware of one side of their world.'
  ],
  'occipital-lobe': [
    'Is the visual processing center of the brain, interpreting information from the eyes.',
    'It allows you to understand what you\'re seeing, including object recognition, color, and motion.',
    'An injury to this area can cause "cortical blindness," where the eyes are healthy but the brain cannot process visual signals.'
  ],
  'general-brain': [ // A fallback for when no specific region is active
    'The adult human brain weighs about 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms).',
    'Your brain generates about 23 watts of power when you are awake, enough to power a dim lightbulb.',
    'While making up only 2% of the body\'s weight, the brain consumes 20% of its oxygen and calories.'
